# best-weather-forecaster
Repo for the Module 6 Challenge. Users can type in any city they wish to see weather data for. It will then display the current weather including max temperature, humidity, and wind speed. It also displays the forecast for the next five days.
Assistance with Javascript functions was provided by TA's in office hours and my peers. Many methods, including Map methods, were taught by TA Sophia and the Object.entries method was learned from this website: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries
This was a very difficult assignment, because of this my focus was on the Javascript and I did not have time to clean up the CSS.
